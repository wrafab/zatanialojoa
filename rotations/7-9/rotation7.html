			<h2>Skateboard Laminating</h2>
			<p>
				The project we carried out throughout Rotation 7 was making a skateboard deck. 
				The first part of the skateboard was the lamination of the various wood sheets with Titebond III glue.

				This part was challenging but we managed to carry out everything at a good speed.

			<h2>Skateboard Vacuum-Bag</h2>
			<p>
				The next step to make the dech was vacuum forming the glued sheets, we had just about 7 minutes to complete step 1 and 2.

				The vacuum bag has a breather to get the air out of the whole bag, and it was closed with a strip of tar to seal everything.

			<h2>Skateboard Vinyl</h2>
			<p>
				While I waited for the skateboard to sit for about 24h, I searched for an image that I would like to use for the skateboard. 
				Then I printed it with the Roland VersaCAMM SP-540i that I learnt how to use during the last rotation. After the 24h, I sanded the skateboard and
				placed the vinyl with the help of some classmates. I decided to cut 2mm from the counour of the vinyl to make it look like a storebought skateboard.

			<h2>Skateboard SPAR Urethane Coating</h2>
			<p>
				The last step to have a new shiny and durable skateboard deck was to put a couple coatings of SPAR Urethane, 
				a varnish that protects the vinyl and the wood.

			<h2>Skateboard End Result</h2>
			<p>
				This project consisted in engraving a Glass using the rotary atachment of the laser cutter
				as shown below. The cghallenge was that the height and width dimensions were confusing.
