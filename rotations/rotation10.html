			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				The main objective for this project was do design and create a kitchen assitant device which would offer the cook a clock a timer and a meat thermometer.
			<br/>
				One of the main considerations was to allow hands free operation since bacterial contamination is to be avoided at all costs in the kitchen environment.
			<br/> <br/>  
				The functions that the clock can perform are:
				<br/> <br/> 
				
				<b>- Current tIme:</b>
				This is simply a display of the current local time.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>-  Ambient temperature:</b>
 				The ambient temperature is an important factor in all food processes that include some kind of fermentation like making bread or yogurts.
				<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Timer:</b>
 				You can easily set a count down timer which will emmit an acoustic alert when the time is up.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Meat thermometer:</b>
 				By inserting the thermocouple inside the food that is being cooked we can know the internal temperature without having to open the oven. We can set an alarm to be triggered when the temperature reaches a certain temperature and the food is cooked.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Estimation of finishing time:</b>
 				By calculating the rate at which the temperature is rising we can estimate when the finishing temperature will be reached. (to be implemented)
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Undercounter light (to be implemented):</b>
 				With the addition of a relay it would be very simple to turn on and off anything pluged in to our device simply with hand movements.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Second and third timers (to be implemented)</b>
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Heating element with thermostat control (to be implemented):</b>
 				An other use for a relay is to plug a heating element to our device which will be placed in a pot with water. If we also insert our thermocouple in the water we can keep it a certain temperature which is ideal for certain low temperature fermentation processes like yogurt.

			<h2>Machine Configurations</h2>

				The next project was making a Drip Irrigation System. Although this was a group project, my parner wasn't here
				so I ended up doing it by myself.

				These are images of different tries I went through. In the first image, the weight was to big on the 
				top so it fell and the printer kept printing on thin air. The second try printed perfectly but it was 
				half a millimeter too small and it didn't fit. Finally, I was able to make one that fits the bottle and work.

			<h2>Time Management</h2>
			<p>
				This was a really time consuming project and I have spent more than 15 hours developing it. The project needed to be programmed from scratch, and 
				that took me the most part of my time. Modeling and designing the box was also a long and tedius process, that took some time.
