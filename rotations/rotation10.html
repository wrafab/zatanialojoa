			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				The main objective for this project was do design and create a kitchen assitant device which would offer the cook a clock a timer and a meat thermometer.
			<br/>
				One of the main considerations was to allow hands free operation since bacterial contamination is to be avoided at all costs in the kitchen environment.
			<br/> <br/>  
				The functions that the clock can perform are:
				<br/> <br/> 
				
				<b>- Current tIme:</b>
				This is simply a display of the current local time.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>-  Ambient temperature:</b>
 				The ambient temperature is an important factor in all food processes that include some kind of fermentation like making bread or yogurts.
				<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Timer:</b>
 				You can easily set a count down timer which will emmit an acoustic xxxxxx when the time is up.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Meat thermometer:</b>
 				By inserting the thermocouple inside the food that is being cooked we can know the internal temperature without having to open the oven. We can set an alarm to be triggered when the temperature reaches a certain temperature and the food is cooked.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Estimation of finishing time:</b>
 				By calculating the rate at which the temperature is rising we can estimate when the finishing temperature will be reached. (to be implemented)
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Undercounter light (to be implemented):</b>
 				With the addition of a relay it would be very simple to turn on and off anything pluged in to our device simply with hand movements.
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Second and third timers (to be implemented)</b>
<br/> <br/> 
				<b>- Heating element with thermostat control:</b>
 				An other use for a relay is to plug a heating element to our device which will be placed in a pot with water. If we also insert our thermocouple in the water we can keep it a certain temperature which is ideal for certain low temperature fermentation processes like yogurt. (to be implemented)

			<h2>Bust</h2>
			<p>
				Rotation 5 started with 3D scanning our upper boddies to create a Bust of ourselves that would be
				3D printed with the resine laser 3D printer.
			</p>
			<img src="bust.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:420px;height:228px;">
			<p>
				Making the bust wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I just joinded both "stl" files in meshmixer and 
				then exported it. Meshmixer gave me some trouble because it didn't want to export my file but after time and patience,
				 it did export it.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Theese are the files that correspond to the bust:

			<h2>3D Object that can't be made subtractevely</h2>
			<p>
				The next project was making an object that can't be made subtractevely. I decided to make a box that
				has a cross on the top, making it really hard to make subtractevely.

			<h2>Irrigation System</h2>
			<p>
				The next project was making a Drip Irrigation System. Although this was a group project, my parner wasn't here
				so I ended up doing it by myself.

			<p> 
				These are images of different tries I went through. In the first image, the weight was to big on the 
				top so it fell and the printer kept printing on thin air. The second try printed perfectly but it was 
				half a millimeter too small and it didn't fit. Finally, I was able to make one that fits the bottle and work.
