			<h2>Stamp Sketch</h2>
			<p>
				The first project project we had was to 3D print something. I decided to go with the stamp and make a stamp 
				with my initials: "AZL".
			</p>
			<img src="img3.JPG" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<p> 
				This is an image of the sketches I made for my Stamp.

			<h2>Stamp Modeling</h2>
			<p>
				The next step for my stam was to model it.

			<h2>Stamp Render and Print</h2>
			<p>
				After modeling, I oppened the file in Makerbot to make a compatible file for the 3D Printer.
				Now, it it was time to print the Stamp.
			</p>
			<p> 
				This is a picture of the stamp, It was really detailed so it was hard to make it work with the wax. In the end,
				I was able to make it print my initials on the wax.
