			<h2>Stamp Sketch</h2>
			<p>
				The first project project we had was to 3D print something. I decided to go with the stamp and make a stamp 
				with my initials: "AZL".

				This is an image of the sketches I made for my Stamp.

			<h2>Stamp Modeling</h2>
			<p>
				In the second design challenge we had to make a ball roll the greatest distance possible but it had to finish within
				a defined area. To do this we used the materials given to make a long path that we were sustaining with our arms
				and we used the mats to try to guide the ball to the are that we had filled with things that stopped the movement
				of the ball before it left the defined area.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Our team won the challenge (again!) out of all the participants because we were really risky but were able to pull off 
				what we had practiced at a long distance.
