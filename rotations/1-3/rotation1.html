			<h2>Design Challenge 1</h2>
			<p>
				The first design challenge we did was to make a structure with the materials provided (Straws, string and
				tape) that could hold a cup and the weight we were putting on it by adding pennies until it came into contact with the ground.

				Our team won the challenge out of all the participants thanks to the structural advantages that triangles offer.

			<h2>Design Challenge 2</h2>
			<p>
				In the second design challenge we had to make a ball roll the greatest distance possible but it had to finish within
				a defined area. To do this we used the materials given to make a long path that we were sustaining with our arms
				and we used the mats to try to guide the ball to the are that we had filled with things that stopped the movement
				of the ball before it left the defined area.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Our team won the challenge (again!) out of all the participants because we were really risky but were able to pull off 
				what we had practiced at a long distance.
