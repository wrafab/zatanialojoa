			<h2>3D Printer</h2>
			<p>
				Rotation 5 is based on 3D printing and scanning. That's why I'm going to give a quick introduction to what are 
				your possibilities with 3D printers.
			</p>

			<p>
				3D printers have the awesome capacity of being able to create (almost) anything you can come to mind with and makeing tests.
				The only limitations to 3D printing are the size and the precission, obviously the file you are trieing to print can't be 
				bigger than the 3D printer itself and it can't be too small either because every 3D printer has a level of precission, 
				wich is the size height that each printed layer has. There are different types of 3D printers, we have the classic FDM wich 
				stands for Fusion Deposition Modeling, and the more advanced SLA with stands for Stereolithography. FDM works by melting material, 
				while SLA works by hardening resine with lasers. Our school has 5 MakerBot's 5th Gen, one FormLabs (SLA) 3D printer 
				and one RepRap X400 3D Printer.

			<h2>Bust</h2>
			<p>
				Rotation 5 started with 3D scanning our upper boddies to create a Bust of ourselves that would be
				3D printed with the resine laser 3D printer.
			</p>
			<img src="bust.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:420px;height:228px;">
			<p>
				Making the bust wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I just joinded both "stl" files in meshmixer and 
				then exported it. Meshmixer gave me some trouble because it didn't want to export my file but after time and patience,
				 it did export it.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Theese are the files that correspond to the bust:

			<h2>3D Object that can't be made subtractevely</h2>
			<p>
				The next project was making an object that can't be made subtractevely. I decided to make a box that
				has a cross on the top, making it really hard to make subtractevely.

			<h2>Irrigation System</h2>
			<p>
				The next project was making a Drip Irrigation System. Although this was a group project, my parner wasn't here
				so I ended up doing it by myself.

			<img src="drip4.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<p> 
				These are images of different tries I went through. In the first image, the weight was to big on the 
				top so it fell and the printer kept printing on thin air. The second try printed perfectly but it was 
				half a millimeter too small and it didn't fit. Finally, I was able to make one that fits the bottle and work.
