			<h2>Puzzle (Part 2)</h2>
			<p>
				To finish the puzzle that we started in rotation 3, we now have to cut it with the laser cutter. During 
				this process I learnt how to use the LaserCutter and how to desing things for it using CorelDraw.

				Making the puzzle was a lot of fun and now I'm going to give it to my sister as a birthday present.
			</p>
			<p> 
				To cut this puzzle I used this file:

			<h2>MakerCase Box</h2>
			<p>
				The next project was making a box with MakerCase, a website that after imputing dimensions will give you
				a file that you can open in coreldraw and use in the Laser Cutter.

			<img src="makerbox3.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<p> 
				I really enjoied using MakerCase as now whenever I need a box I can just come to CTIC and create one in less than 10 minutes.
			</p>
			<p> 
				These are images of the box I made. File:

			<h2>Press-fit Kit</h2>
			<p>
				The next project was making a cardboard press fit kit.
			</p>
			<img src="pressfit.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<img src="pressfit1.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<img src="pressfit2.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<img src="pressfit3.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<p> 
				These are images of the pieces I made. To make them I measured the width of the cardboard I would use
				and then when designing it in Fusion360 I made various geometrical shapes with incisions of the same width. Making the 
				press fit kit was really challenging because it involved making exact cuts for all the pieces because if not, the peices wouldn't 
				have fit together. After making it, Darius made sme figures with them (Illustration 3).

			<h2>Metal Bookmark</h2>
			<p>
				This project consisted in engraving a metal bookmark as shown below, this project was a really easy project as we had already
				 done multiple things with the laser cutter. I decided to engrave my name on the front and the name of my hometown and Hudson 
				in the back.

			<h2>Glass Cup</h2>
			<p>
				This project consisted in engraving a Glass using the rotary atachment of the laser cutter
				as shown below. The cghallenge was that the height and width dimensions were confusing.
			</p>
			<img src="cup1.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<img src="cup2.jpg" alt="Sketch" style="width:200px;height:304px;">
			<p> 
				This is a picture of the process and end result. 
				Finally I was able to engrave the cup with my name and stars. The engrave was a bit shifted from were I would have wanted 
				it to be so, next time I'll have the importance of the dimmensions in mind.
